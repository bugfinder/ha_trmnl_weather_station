# TRMNL Home Assistant Weather Station

Use your **TRMNL** display to monitor **weather data** from your **home assistant**.

This is based on the work of Tilman Griesel but heavily modified to fit my specific purpose.

This started as one of the kindle based weather displays, where I set several values
in a svg that was then scaled and displayed on an old scratchy kindle.
With TRMNL available I finally started work on replacing that.
